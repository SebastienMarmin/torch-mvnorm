Torch-MvNorm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this small piece of code you can

- Integrate multivariate normal densities (CDFs)
- Easily obtain partial derivatives of CDFs w.r.t location, mean and covariance (implementation of closed-form formulas, see e.g. [Marmin et al. 2019](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01133220v4/document), appendix 6)
- Manipulate quantities within a tensor-based framework (e.g. broadcasting is fully supported)

## About Torch-MvNorm

Torch-MvNorm is a library that consists of the two following components:

- **integration** -- PyTorch-Fortan bridge for [Alan Genz's routine](http://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/genz/software/fort77/mvndstpack.f) using SciPy.
- **multivariate_normal_cdf** -- implementation of the formula of the multivariate normal CDF gradient, with respect to location and covariance.

There is no GPU support. I am still looking for the best way to perform integrations of normal densities with GPUs. If you want, please share your opinion on this, e.g. opening an issue.

## Installation


### Dependencies

- [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

- Install joblib python module, e.g.
```
sudo apt-get install -y python3-joblib
```

- Install SciPy python module.

### Get the Torch-MvNorm source
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SebastienMarmin/torch-mvnorm
cd torch-mvnorm
```

### Test the code
```
import torch
from torch.autograd import grad
from mvnorm import multivariate_normal_cdf as Phi

d = 3
x = torch.randn(d)
m = torch.zeros(d)
Croot = torch.randn(d,d)
C = Croot.mm(Croot.t())+torch.diag(torch.ones(d))

x.requires_grad = True
m.requires_grad = True
C.requires_grad = True

P = Phi(x,m,C)
dPdx, dPdm, dPdC = grad(P,(x,m,C)) # Bien s√ªr, dPdx = -dPdm.
```

## Getting Started

- Run the code on [small examples](https://github.com/SebastienMarmin/torch-mvnorm/blob/master/tests).
- Have a look at [the documentation](https://sebastienmarmin.github.io/torch-mvnorm/).
